    start:
      title: "A collaborative way to foster research into our human past"
      get-started: 'Get Started'
      steps:
        first:
          title: "1. Submit an Idea"
          description: "A first step in getting started with a MicroPasts crowd-funding project is to come up with an idea and find some equally enthusiastic people to work on it (representing a healthy mix of volunteers and traditional academics). Then fill in this short form [link] and send it to us â€” we'll then help ensure your proposal fits well with MicroPasts' emphasis on open research collaboration."
        second:
          title: '2. Plan Your Campaign'
          description: "It is worth thinking about how to promote your project bid once it is launched on the crowd-funding site. Take some time to create a publicity plan to help ensure your bid for financial support is a success."
        third:
          title: '3. Launch Your Campaign'
          description: "Once your project is developed, approved and we have a few bits of necessary content from you, then you'll be ready to go live and start raising money."
      who:
        title: 'Who can run a campaign?'
        description: 'All of our projects need to demonstrate that they will involve a working partnership between one or more members of the public (better yet an organised volunteer group such as a historical society) and an academic institution. You may already have the necessary contacts for such a partnership or you might look to build such a relationship via our <a href="http://community.micropasts.org" title="The community forum">forum</a>.'
      work:
        title: 'A successful crowd-funding campaign does not usually happen on its own, but takes some work'
        subtitle: "So here's what you'll need:"
        team:
          title: 'A good group'
          description: "You'll need an active and engaged team with a mix of talents, and the right community and institutional backing. Make this your first priority and make sure to develop any project proposal together. "
        imagery:
          title: 'A beautiful image'
          description: 'A picture is worth a thousand words. We will want one or more eye-catching still images to advertise you project on the MicroPasts site and engage potential contributors.'
        video:
          title: 'A powerful video'
          description: 'A short video is usually the best way to allow contributors to get a glimpse of you, any organisations that are backing you and your overall project idea. Videos are not mandatory, but are increasingly easy to produce and really worth the effort! '
        detailed:
          title: 'Project details'
          description: 'You will need to tell people about your plans in a little more detail. The more users know about your project and how you plan to use their money, the more likely they are to contribute.'
        rewards:
          title: 'Compelling rewards'
          description: 'If you can, it is worth offering some incentives to possible contributors by promising to show them some early fruits of your work, providing a route by which they might get involved if they want, or simply by outlining some some nice ways that you will thank them for their support.'
        engagement:
          title: 'Sustained contact'
          description: 'It is really worth staying in contact with your supporters while spreading the message to new ones. Engagement is often key to a successful crowd-funding campaign.'

        title: 'Need a little inspiration?'
        subtitle: 'You can read <a href="/how-it-works" title="How it works in detail">detailed guidance</a> or check out other campaigns!'
